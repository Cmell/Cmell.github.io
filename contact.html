    I am a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Boulder</a> in the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/social-psychology/">social psychology program</a>. I study prejudice and stereotyping from a social cognitive perspective under the direction of my advisors, <a href="http://psych.colorado.edu/~jclab/index.html">Joshua Correll</a> and <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/bernadette-park">Bernadette Park</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Two main themes drive my work. First, I want to understand the role that groups play in the way that people think about themselves, and the motivational implications of group membership. Second, I want to augment sound experimental work with sophisticated quantitative techniques. This has led me to investigate the role of group membership in the self-concept, the effects of stereotypes on the decision to shoot Black vs. White suspects, and the ways that group-level personality traits might affect the way that group members are perceived. See my projects page for more information on each of these.

    I love to rock climb, hike, and camp. The mountains near Boulder give me plenty of easy access to all three. I also started skiing recently, and hope to be in the backcountry after one or two seasons of practice. I also like to make things. I built a 3d printer (based on <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel">this design</a>), and I am currently working on building a tricopter (something like <a href"http://makezine.com/projects/build-your-first-tricopter/">this one</a>).
